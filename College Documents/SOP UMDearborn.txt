At an early age I had passion for math and coding, leading me to pursue Information Technology Engineering. In my freshman and sophomore years, I honed my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms, while also gaining experience in many programming languages like JAVA, Python etc and technologies like MATLAB, Android Development etc. Junior year exposed me to the fascinating intersection of analytics, mathematics, and data visualization, sparking my interest in Data Analytics.

Interning at Cureya and TwoWaits in my junior year, I worked with datasets performing analyses and modeling. 
In senior year, undertaking IBM's Data Science summer camp I completed various online certifications and worked on a semester-long project deriving insights from datasets, implementing statistical analysis and designing model for case study. Wanting to explore the industry before finally settling to pursue my master's, I spent more than a year witnessing the growing relevance of Machine Learning and AI in the industry and day-to-day life particularly through tools like ChatGPT.

Now, having gained experience from industry, I am eager to expand my knowledge in Analytics and Machine Learning and fill important gaps in my CS background. The Analytics program at Michigan Tech University, renowned for its depth and industry alignment, offers three unique tracks to pursue one's career goals. The track I am interested is Computational Data Analytics, which provides a lot of flexibility in electives, helpful to fine-tune the curriculum. It seamlessly blend of courses relevant to both technical and business aspects, aligning perfectly for my academic and career aspirations.
